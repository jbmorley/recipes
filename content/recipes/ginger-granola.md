# Ingredients

- Rolled Oats -- 400g
- Pecans -- 2 Handfuls
- Coconut Flakes -- 2 Handfuls
- Olive Oil -- 6 Table Spoons
- Honey -- 6 Table Spoons
- Candied Ginger -- 2 Handfuls

I find this makes roughly two weeks of granola; adjust quantities to your own tastes and needs.

# Method

1. Pre-heat the oven to 250Â°F.
2. Crunch the coconut flakes and pecans into smaller, irregular pieces by hand.
3. Combine the oats, nuts, and coconut flakes and spread them evenly over a baking tray.
4. Mix the honey and olive oil in a bowl until you have a uniform syrup.
5. Pour the honey and olive oil mix evenly over the oats, nuts, and coconut flakes.
6. Using a spatula, ensure an even coating of honey and oil.
7. Bake for 1 hour 20 minutes, turning every 20 minutes, breaking up larger chunks when they form.
8. Allow the granola to cool and then mix in the candied ginger.
