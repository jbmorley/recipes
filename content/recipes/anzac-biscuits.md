When I was growing up, visiting our family friends in the Lake District was a highlight of the year. As were the flapjacks they made--treats that brought me comfort all the way through to my time at university, when an occasional care package would bring a taste of home.

Having craved these for many years, I finally reached out for the recipe so I could make my own. It turns out they're actually 'Anzac biscuits', and very easy to make.
